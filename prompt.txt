This is an html javascript app called Virtual Particle Accelerator. 
Make it look sleek and professional like react material ui, without using those libraries.

Create a particule simulator that creates at least 1 million particles.
The particles are visualized in the browser using GPU acceleration. 
The particles must collide with each other.
Do not use any third party libraries.
Keep files modular where possible.

Use any GPU optimization possible to get the most amount of particles in the best frame rate.
