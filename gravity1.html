    <h1>Gravity is Particle Occlusion</h1>
    <p class="byline">Karl Lilje &nbsp;·&nbsp; 2016 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Particle Lab Interactive Simulation</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <div class="abstract">
        This paper proposes that gravitational attraction between macroscopic bodies emerges naturally
        from the pressure of an underlying particle field, without requiring a dedicated force law.
        When two opaque bodies are immersed in an isotropic sea of fast-moving particles, each body
        casts a <em>pressure shadow</em> on the other. The resulting asymmetry in radiation pressure
        drives the bodies toward each other. The magnitude of the emergent force scales with particle
        density, particle speed, and the cross-sectional areas of the bodies — reproducing the
        qualitative behaviour of Newtonian gravity from first principles.
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Background: Le Sage's Shadow Gravity</h2>
    <p>
        The idea that gravity could arise from particle occlusion was first proposed by Nicolas Fatio
        de Duillier (1690) and later independently by Georges-Louis Le Sage (1748). In Le Sage's model,
        space is filled with ultra-fast corpuscles (<em>ultramundane particles</em>) moving in all
        directions. An isolated body intercepts these corpuscles equally from all sides and experiences
        no net force. When a second body is present, each body shields the other from a fraction of the
        incoming flux, producing a net push toward the other body.
    </p>
    <p>
        The classical objection to Le Sage gravity was that the corpuscles would heat the bodies and
        slow over time, violating energy conservation. The simulation presented here sidesteps this by
        treating the particle field as a thermodynamic bath maintained at constant temperature — the
        particles are continuously re-emitted at full speed after absorption, representing the nucleus
        re-emitting absorbed vacuum energy.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the modern era we have evidence of the Higgs Field, as well as the nucleus of atoms. 
        Combined they explain the gravitational force as a pressure difference between the nucleus and the 
        vacuum, plus an absorbtion coefficient. Instead of prticles made from matter, 
        a working model would have particles made from the Higgs field itself. My work is a proof of 
        concept that the mechanism of gravity as particle occlusion is physically consistent and numerically 
        verifiable, even if the actual particles in our universe are not the same as those in the simulation.
        Currently this is the only known mechanism that can reproduce the inverse-square law of gravity without invoking action at a distance,
        and it is directly observable in the simulation by watching two absorbing bodies drift together over time.
        The simulation is a proof of concept that the mechanism of gravity as particle occlusion is physically consistent and numerically verifiable.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Particle Field</h2>
    <p>
        The simulation maintains a uniform sea of $N$ particles distributed randomly across the domain
        $\Omega$, each with speed drawn from a uniform distribution:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$v_i \sim \mathcal{U}(v_{\min},\, v_{\max})$$</div>
    <p>
        The particles move in straight lines, collide elastically with boundaries, and are redistributed
        isotropically after absorption. The mean free path is long compared to the body radii, so the
        field approximates an ideal gas in the continuum limit.
        The radiation pressure on any surface element $dA$ from an isotropic particle bath is:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$dF = P \, dA \qquad \text{where} \quad P = nkT$$</div>
    <p>
        with $n$ the local number density, $k$ Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ the effective temperature
        of the particle bath.
    </p>

    <h2>3. The Occlusion Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
        Consider two spherical bodies $A$ and $B$ of radii $r_A$, $r_B$ separated by distance $d$
        (centre to centre), with $d \gg r_A, r_B$.
    </p>

    <h3>3.1 Symmetric case (single body)</h3>
    <p>
        A single body in an isotropic field receives equal flux from all directions.
        The net force is zero by symmetry:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$\mathbf{F}_{\text{net}} = \oint_S P\,\hat{n}\,dA = \mathbf{0}$$</div>

    <h3>3.2 Two-body case (shadow deficit)</h3>
    <p>
        Body $B$ intercepts a cone of solid angle
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$\Delta\Omega = \frac{\pi r_B^2}{d^2}$$</div>
    <p>
        as seen from body $A$. This cone is partially depleted of incoming particles.
        The <em>shadow deficit</em> on the face of $A$ pointing toward $B$ is:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$\delta P = P_0 \cdot \frac{\pi r_B^2}{4\pi d^2} \cdot \eta$$</div>
    <p>
        where $P_0$ is the ambient bath pressure and $\eta \in [0,1]$ is the opacity of $B$.
        The net force on $A$ directed toward $B$ is then:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$F_{A \leftarrow B} = \delta P \cdot \pi r_A^2 = P_0 \, \eta \, \frac{r_A^2 \, r_B^2}{4 \, d^2}$$</div>
    <p>
        Noting that $P_0 = nkT$ and that the cross-sectional areas $\sigma_A = \pi r_A^2$,
        $\sigma_B = \pi r_B^2$ scale with mass for uniform-density bodies
        ($m \propto r^3$, so $\sigma \propto m^{2/3}$), we recover an inverse-square force:
    </p>
    <div class="boxed">$$F \propto \frac{\sigma_A \, \sigma_B}{d^2} \propto \frac{m_A^{2/3} \, m_B^{2/3}}{d^2}$$</div>
    <p>
        For point-like, fully absorbing nuclei the cross-section saturates and the dependence
        approaches $F \propto m_A m_B / d^2$, recovering Newton exactly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Simulation Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        The simulation implements this mechanism directly. Each frame, for every particle that
        enters an absorbing body:
    </p>
    <pre>for each particle i:
    move particle by velocity × dt

    for each absorbing body B:
        if particle is inside B:
            // Transfer momentum to body
            B.vx += particle.vx / B.mass
            B.vy += particle.vy / B.mass
            // Teleport particle to random location outside all bodies
            // Assign fresh isotropic velocity</pre>

    <p>Key parameters of the Gravity preset:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Particles</td><td>75,000</td><td>Sets bath density $n$</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Speed multiplier</td><td>0.3</td><td>Sets effective temperature $T$</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Damping</td><td>0.98</td><td>Near-elastic boundary collisions</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Particle collisions</td><td>off</td><td>Reduces inter-particle scattering noise</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wrap edges</td><td>on</td><td>Maintains constant $n$ (periodic boundary)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Body radius</td><td>120 px</td><td>Sets cross-section $\sigma$</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Body mass</td><td>100</td><td>Sets inertia for momentum integration</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The momentum transferred per absorbed particle is:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$\Delta \mathbf{p}_{\text{body}} = \frac{m_{\text{particle}}}{m_{\text{body}}} \mathbf{v}_{\text{particle}}$$</div>
    <p>
        Summed over all absorbed particles per unit time, this gives a continuous force directed toward
        the net incoming flux — which is reduced on the side facing the other body, producing attraction.
    </p>

    <h2>5. The Emergent Force Field</h2>
    <p>
        The force field visualisation (enable <em>Show Force Field</em>) displays the local kinetic
        energy density of the particle bath:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \in \text{cell}(\mathbf{x})} m v_i^2$$</div>
    <p>
        The shadow between the two bodies is clearly visible as a low-energy (cool, dark) corridor.
        The pressure differential across each body — higher on the outer face, lower on the inner face —
        is the direct cause of the attractive force. No action at a distance is required.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Radiative Transport Formula</h2>
    <p>
        The full radiative transport equation for the force density on an absorbing medium is:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">
        $$\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = \kappa(\mathbf{x})\, \frac{P}{c}
        \int_{4\pi} f_0 \exp\!\left(-\int_0^{\infty} \kappa(\mathbf{x} - s\,\boldsymbol{\Omega})\,ds\right)
        \boldsymbol{\Omega}\, d\Omega$$
    </div>
    <p>
        where $\kappa$ is the opacity, $f_0$ is the isotropic bath flux, and the exponential is the
        Beer-Lambert attenuation along ray direction $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$.
        In the optically thin limit ($\kappa \to 0$ everywhere except at the body surfaces)
        this reduces to the geometric shadow formula derived in Section 3.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Predictions and Observables</h2>
    <p>This model makes several testable predictions within the simulation:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Force scales as $d^{-2}$</strong> — doubling the separation should quarter the
        attractive force, as the solid angle of the shadow scales as $d^{-2}$.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Force scales with cross-section</strong> — larger bodies attract more strongly,
        independent of their mass. Mass dependence enters only through opacity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Three-body shielding</strong> — placing a third body between two others should
        reduce the pairwise attraction, because the intermediate body re-emits particles isotropically,
        partially filling the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. Retarded propagation</strong> — perturbations in the particle bath propagate at the
        mean particle speed, not instantaneously. Gravitational "signals" are therefore retarded,
        analogous to the finite speed of gravity in general relativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>5. Inertia–gravity equivalence</strong> — the same particle bath that produces
        attraction also carries momentum, so a body accelerated through the bath experiences drag
        proportional to its cross-section, connecting inertial mass and gravitational cross-section.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Discussion</h2>

    <h3>Why bodies attract and not repel</h3>
    <p>
        A common intuition is that being hit by particles from all sides should push bodies
        <em>apart</em>. This is incorrect. An isolated body is in equilibrium — equal pressure from
        all directions. It is the <em>deficit</em> of pressure on the facing surfaces that produces
        attraction. The net force is always directed toward any nearby absorbing body, not away from it.
    </p>

    <h3>Energy conservation</h3>
    <p>
        Classical Le Sage gravity requires the corpuscles to slow down (losing kinetic energy to heat),
        eventually dissipating. In the present model the absorbed particles are immediately re-emitted
        at full speed from a random location, maintaining constant $T$. This represents the body acting
        as a quantum absorber-emitter — absorbing a vacuum fluctuation and re-emitting it in a random
        direction, consistent with the zero-point field interpretation.
    </p>

    <h3>Connection to general relativity</h3>
    <p>
        The pressure-shadow model is Lorentz-covariant in the limit where the particle bath moves at
        the speed of light. In this limit the shadow geometry reproduces the geodesic deviation of
        general relativity to first order. The effective metric perturbation is:
    </p>
    <div class="eq-block">$$h_{00} \approx -\frac{2\delta P}{P_0} = -\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}$$</div>
    <p>reproducing the Schwarzschild weak-field result.</p>

    <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gravity as particle occlusion is a physically consistent, numerically verifiable mechanism that:</p>
    <p>— Requires no action at a distance</p>
    <p>— Emerges from a single postulate: <em>space is filled with an isotropic particle bath</em></p>
    <p>— Reproduces the inverse-square law geometrically</p>
    <p>— Connects gravitational and inertial mass through cross-sectional area</p>
    <p>— Is directly observable in the simulation by watching two absorbing bodies drift together</p>
