Add the ability to load preset layouts from json files:

1. a blank field with 100000 particles
2. a recreation of the double slit experiment- made from three solid blocks with a small gap inbetween for the particles to flow. 
This will require adding the ability to add solid collision shapes.

e.g. [
        {
        name : "Small Field",
        particles: 1000
    },
    {
    name : "Blank Field",
    particles: 100000
},
name: "Double Slit Experiment",
    particles: 100000,
    box: {coordinates: 10, 10, 50, 20},
    box: {coordinates: 60, 10, 150, 20},
    box: {coordinates: 160, 10, 250, 20}
