# ParticlePlayground - Application Summary
## Based on the research by Karl R Lilje

## Overview
ParticlePlayground is an interactive physics simulation application built with Python and Pygame. It provides a real-time particle physics sandbox with various forces, constraints, and interactive features.

## Core Features

### Particle System
- Dynamic particle creation and management
- Each particle has position, velocity, mass, radius, and color properties
- Supports multiple particle types with different behaviors
- Collision detection and elastic collision physics
- Particle lifecycle management (creation, update, removal)

### Physics Simulations
- **Gravity**: Configurable global gravity affecting all particles
- **Friction/Damping**: Air resistance to slow down particles over time
- **Elastic Collisions**: Realistic particle-to-particle collision responses
- **Wall Bouncing**: Particles bounce off screen boundaries with energy conservation

### Interactive Forces
- **Attraction Force**: Attracts particles toward mouse cursor
- **Repulsion Force**: Pushes particles away from mouse cursor
- **Tornado Force**: Creates a swirling vortex effect around the cursor
- Forces can be toggled on/off and adjusted in strength

### Constraints & Connections
- **Springs**: Elastic connections between particles with configurable stiffness and damping
- **Rigid Rods**: Fixed-length connections that maintain constant distance
- **Chains**: Series of connected particles forming flexible structures
- Constraint visualization with color-coded rendering

### Visualization Options
- **Velocity Vectors**: Visual representation of particle motion direction and speed
- **Trails**: Motion trails showing particle paths over time
- **Grid Overlay**: Reference grid for spatial awareness
- **Force Field Visualization**: Shows active force fields and their intensity

### User Controls
- Mouse-based particle creation and interaction
- Keyboard shortcuts for toggling features:
  - Forces (attraction, repulsion, tornado)
  - Visualization options (vectors, trails, grid)
  - Physics parameters (gravity, friction)
  - Constraint creation modes
- Real-time parameter adjustment via UI sliders/controls

### Performance Features
- Optimized collision detection using spatial partitioning
- Configurable maximum particle count
- Frame rate limiting and smooth rendering
- Efficient update loops for large particle systems
